# lmfit migration regression tests — data file configuration
#
# Fill in paths to real HDF5 experiment files for each fitting class.
# Tests will SKIP any entry that is null or points to a missing file.
#
# Interface 1 (priority): fit_display_classes models
# These load raw data from HDF5 and pass it to the fitting class directly.
fit_display_classes:
  RamseyFitting: null          # needs: xpts, avgi, avgq + config with ramsey_freq, qubits, checkEF
  AmplitudeRabiFitting: null   # needs: xpts, avgi, avgq, amps + config with sigma_test
  Spectroscopy: null           # needs: xpts, avgi, avgq, amps
  LengthRabiFitting: null      # needs: xpts, avgi, avgq

# Interface 2: Experiment.from_h5file() -> analyze()
# These load via the experiment class constructor and run the full pipeline.
