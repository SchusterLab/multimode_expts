"""The MBR acquisition spine: load an occupation, scramble it, read it back.

Two programs, and every MBR stage is a subclass of the second one.

``SidebandScrambleDarkProgramNewNew``
    Load a chosen collective mode, play the scramble, read the mode back. It
    inherits the scramble from ``SidebandScrambleProgram`` and the dark-mode
    load/read from ``DarkBaseProgram``, in that MRO order, so
    ``super().core_pulses()`` is the scramble and the encoding methods come
    from the dark base.

``NPhotonHamiltonianSpectroscopyProgram``
    The complex diagonal return of one occupation string. Prepares an
    arbitrary N-photon occupation across the storage modes through the
    manipulate mode, applies the Floquet cycle, inverts the encoder, and
    reconstructs the complex amplitude from a four-point phase cycle
    (theta = 0, 180 on the first qubit half-pi; phi = 0, 90 on the last).

    This is also the spectrum stage's program, unchanged -- spectrum measures
    exactly the diagonal return, so it extends nothing.

The decoder phase convention lives in this class's docstring and is the part
worth reading before changing anything here: which axis each row of
``decoder_phase_matrix`` is, and why the storage rows enter the inverse
M1-storage pulses with the opposite sign.

The stage program variants are in their own modules -- calibration in
``mbr_phase_correction``, propagator in ``mbr_propagator``, orthogonality in
``mbr_orthogonality``. Their old aggregate Experiments are in ``deprecated/legacy_mbr``.
